## ImageInfo

bash script to get a badge with human readable Docker image size , creation time  and number of layers.
Should look like (or better than ) the broken ImageLayers.io.

The badge is created with <a href="https://shields.io/">shields.io</a> by default but you can supply `SHIELDS_SERVER` .
